```

### 3. **Additional Analytics and Reports Features:**

- **Order Reports:** You can also implement charts for tracking total orders and order statuses over time.
- **Filter by Date Range:** Add date range filters to allow admins to view reports for custom periods (e.g., last 30 days, this week, etc.).

```html
<div class="date-filter">
    <label for="dateStart">Start Date:</label>
    <input type="date" id="dateStart">
    <label for="dateEnd">End Date:</label>
    <input type="date" id="dateEnd">
    <button onclick="fetchReports()">Filter</button>
</div>
```

### Summary:
- **Revenue Reports:** Using **Chart.js**, you can generate dynamic line charts for revenue trends.
- **Sales Reports:** A bar chart for product sales.
- **Admin Activity Log:** A table that displays actions taken by admins, such as product additions and user management tasks.
  
Next, we can continue with implementing **Search and Filter Functionality** or move to another feature of your choice. Let me know how you'd like to proceedLet's move on to the next feature: **Real-Time Notifications** with **Push Notifications** integration.

We'll add **Socket.io** for in-app notifications and integrate **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** for push notifications to provide a complete real-time notification system for your admin dashboard.

### 1. **Socket.io for Real-Time In-App Notifications**

**Steps:**
- Set up **Socket.io** for sending and receiving notifications in real-time.
- Display notifications in the admin dashboard as soon as events happen, like new orders or low stock alerts.

#### **Backend (Socket.io) Configuration:**

We’ve already initialized **Socket.io** in the previous step. Let’s build upon that with real-time notifications for events like new orders.

#### Modify **Socket.io** in `app.js`:

```javascript
// app.js (Continuing from previous)

```

#### **Front-End JavaScript**:

To listen for real-time notifications on the front end, we’ll use **Socket.io-client**. Make sure you include the Socket.io library in your front-end code.

```html
<!-- Include Socket.io in your admin dashboard -->

<script>
    
</script>
```

Now, whenever an event occurs (e.g., new order, low stock), notifications will be pushed to the admin panel in real-time.

### 2. **Push Notifications with Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**

To add **push notifications**, we'll integrate **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** for web push notifications that work outside the application.

#### **Setting up Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**:

1. **Create a Firebase Project**:
   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Create a new project.

2. **Add Firebase to Your Web App**:
   - In your Firebase project, go to **Project Settings**.
   - Under the **General** tab, scroll to the **Your apps** section and click **Web** to register your web app.
   - Copy your **Firebase SDK Config**.

3. **Install Firebase SDK**:
   - Install the Firebase SDK in your project:
   ```bash
   npm install firebase
   ```

4. **Add Firebase Config in the Front-End**:

   ```html
   <script>
       // Firebase configuration
       const firebaseConfig = {
           apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
           authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
           projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
           storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
           messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
           appId: "YOUR_APP_ID"
       };

       // Initialize Firebase
       const app = firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
       const messaging = firebase.messaging();

       // Get registration token for push notifications
       messaging.getToken({ vapidKey: 'YOUR_VAPID_KEY' }).then((currentToken) => {
           if (currentToken) {
               console.log('Token:', currentToken);
               // Send token to server to subscribe for push notifications
           } else {
               console.log('No registration token available. Request permission to generate one.');
           }
       }).catch((err) => {
           console.log('An error occurred while retrieving token.', err);
       });

       // Listen for incoming messages
       messaging.onMessage((payload) => {
           console.log('Message received. ', payload);
           // Display push notification
           alert(`New Notification: ${payload.notification.title}`);
       });
       
// Send push notification for new order
const sendPushNotification = async (token, message) => {
    const payload = {
        notification: {
            title: 'New Order',
            body: `Order #${message.orderId} has been placed.`,
        }
    };

    try {
        await admin.messaging().sendToDevice(token, payload);
        console.log('Push notification sent');
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error sending push notification:', error);
    }
};

// Trigger when new order event occurs
socket.on('newOrder', (orderData) => {
    const message = {
        orderId: orderData.orderId
    };
    // Send notification to the user's device token
    sendPushNotification(userDeviceToken, message);
});
   </script>
   ```

5. **Backend Integration with Firebase FCM**:
   You can trigger push notifications from your server-side application whenever significant events occur.

   Use the **Firebase Admin SDK** to send push notifications from your back-end:

   ```bash
   npm install firebase-admin
   ```

   Create a Firebase admin instance:

   ```javascript
   // config/firebase.js
   const admin = require('firebase-admin');
   const serviceAccount = require('./path/to/your-firebase-service-account.json');

   admin.initializeApp({
       credential: admin.credential.cert(serviceAccount),
       databaseURL: "https://your-project-id.firebaseio.com"
   });

   module.exports = admin;
   ```

#### **Send Push Notifications from Backend**:

Whenever an important event occurs (like a new order), you can trigger a push notification to all subscribed users.

```javascript
```

### 3. **Push Notification Handling on the Front-End**

On receiving a push notification, users will see the notification as a browser pop-up even if they aren’t actively on the site.

```javascript
// Handle incoming message
messaging.onMessage((payload) => {
    console.log('Message received. ', payload);
    // Display push notification
    const notificationOptions = {
        body: payload.notification.body,
        icon: '/icon.png'
    };

    new Notification(payload.notification.title, notificationOptions);
});
```

### Summary:
- **Socket.io** allows for in-app real-time notifications for events like new orders or stock updates.
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging** adds push notification functionality, which can notify users even when they are not actively using the admin panel.
  
With these notification systems, your admin panel will be capable of sending both real-time in-app notifications and push notifications for important events. Next steps could involve **customizing notification content**, handling **read/unread states**, and adding **notifications history**.

Let me know if you would like to move forward with additional features or modifications!!### **4. Search and Filter Functionality**

This feature will enhance user experience by allowing admins to search and filter through products, users, and orders based on multiple criteria (e.g., category, date range, order status). We will also add **auto-suggestion/autocomplete** functionality to provide quick search results.

#### **HTML Structure for the Search and Filter:**

We will create a search bar and filter section within the admin dashboard.
Here is an updated version of the `App.js` file that includes rendering static files:
```
jsx

### Steps Explained:
1. **AJAX Request for Login**:
   - When the user submits the login form, we prevent the default form submission (`e.preventDefault()`).
   - We collect the username and password, then send them via a `POST` request to a `/api/login` endpoint.
   - The server should handle authentication and return a success or failure response.

2. **Handling Server Response**:
   - If the login is successful, we redirect the user to the admin dashboard using `window.location.href = "/admin-dashboard"`.
   - If login fails, we display an alert with the failure message.

3. **Modular Form Handling**:
   - The code is structured so that similar AJAX handlers can be added for phone number and email login by adding event listeners to those forms.

### Backend Side (Server API Endpoint):
For the AJAX to work correctly, you need a corresponding **server-side** endpoint (e.g., `/api/login`) that authenticates the user. Here's a basic idea of how the backend might look in **Node.js** (assuming you're using it):

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');

app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

### Next Step:
1. **Session Management**: Once the login succeeds, we need to handle user sessions using cookies or tokens (e.g., JWT) to maintain the user's login state across pages.
2. **Role-based Access Control (RBAC)**: After successful login, you can implement RBAC logic to ensure users only see sections of the admin panel they are authorized to access based on their role.

Let me know if you'd like to proceed with session management and RBAC!


To enhance **safety** and ensure a **robust** system in your code, you should implement logic to handle potential issues like validation, error handling, and fallbacks. I'll walk through the key areas where logic should be added to ensure safety and robustness in the code.

### 1. **Image Path Validation**
   - Ensure that the image path exists and provide a fallback image if the logo fails to load.

   ```html
   <img src="assets/images/logo.png" onerror="this.src='assets/images/default-logo.png';" alt="Logo">
   ```

   - This will ensure that if the logo fails to load, a default image (`default-logo.png`) is shown.

### 2. **FullCalendar CSS/JS Fallback**
   You can include fallback logic in case the CDN fails by providing a local alternative:

   ```html

   ```

   - If the CDN fails, it will attempt to load the local version of the FullCalendar assets.

### 3. **Form Validation**
   For the form submissions (`add-product-form` and `add-cashier-form`), you should add client-side validation to ensure the data is correct before sending it to the server.

   **Example: Add Product Form Validation**
   ```javascript









  
No, there are a few more things to consider:

- Error handling: You should add try-catch blocks to handle errors that may occur during the order submission and retrieval process.
- Validation: You should validate the order data before submitting it to the database to ensure that it is correct and complete.
- Security: You should consider adding security measures such as authentication and authorization to ensure that only authorized users can submit orders and view order history.
- Database schema: You will need to create a database schema to store the order data. This will involve creating tables for orders, customers, products, and other relevant data.
- Frontend code: You will need to write frontend code to display the order history and submit new orders. This will involve using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a user interface.

Here is an updated version of the code that includes some of these considerations:

_order.js_
```
```

_app.js_
```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
```

This is still a basic example and you will need to add more functionality and error handling to make it production-ready.Here is an updated version of the checkout page with actual logic implemented:

_checkout.html_
```
<!-- ... -->
<!-- ... -->
```

_checkout.js_
Here is the rest of the code:

```
```

Note that the `processPayment` and `placeOrder` functions are not implemented here, as they would require integration with a payment gateway and order management system, respectively. You would need to implement these functions according to your specific requirements.

Also, the `cartItemsData` variable is assumed to be an array of objects, where each object represents a cart item with properties such as `name`, `price`, and `quantity`. You would need to modify the code to match your specific cart data structure.To send notifications to the admin and cashier, you can use JavaScript to update the notification containers in the dashboard/admin and cashier.html pages.

Here's an example of how you can do it:

```

```

Make sure to replace the `message-container`, `notification-container`, and `order-history` IDs with the actual IDs of the containers in your HTML.

To send notifications in real-time, you would need to use a backend technology like Node.js, Python, or Ruby to send notifications to the admin and cashier dashboards. This would involve setting up a server-side application that listens for new orders and sends notifications to the relevant dashboards.

To record orders in the order history section, you would need to store the order data in a database or file system, and then retrieve and display it in the order history container. This would also require a backend technology to manage the data storage and retrieval.Here's an example of how you can implement the order submission and storage in the database using Node.js, and then retrieve and display the order history:

*db.js*
```

```

*order.js*
```
