Certainly! Below, I'll provide you with the SQL schema, seed data, and queries to manage messages, users, presence, and other relevant features for your messaging system. This will include handling media uploads and other functionalities you mentioned.

### 1. **SQL Schema**

Hereâ€™s a proposed schema for your messaging system, including tables for users, messages, presence statuses, and media uploads:

```sql

```

### 2. **SQL Seed Data**

You can use the following SQL seed data to populate your database with initial data for testing:

```sql

```

### 3. **SQL Queries**

Here are the SQL queries you can use for adding, removing, and managing users, messages, presence, and other functionalities:

#### Adding a User
```sql
INSERT INTO users (username, password, email) VALUES (?, ?, ?);
```

#### Removing a User
```sql
```

#### Adding a Message
```sql
```

#### Updating a Message Status (e.g., mark as read)
```sql
```

#### Retrieving User Messages (Inbox)
```sql
```

#### Marking a Message as Spam
```sql
```

#### Updating Presence Status
```sql
```

#### Retrieving User Presence
```sql
```

#### Removing a Message
```sql
```

### 4. **Media Handling and Uploads**

For media uploads, you may need a separate table to handle uploaded files or include a media URL in the messages table. 

#### Media Upload Example
```sql
-- This can be part of your media handling logic in your backend
```

In your backend, make sure to handle file uploads (using libraries like `multer` in Node.js) and store the uploaded file's URL in the `mediaUrl` field of the messages table.

### 5. **Additional Features to Consider**
- **Message Reactions**: You may want to implement a feature that allows users to react to messages (like, dislike, laugh, etc.).
- **Typing Indicators**: You could enhance the user experience by implementing typing indicators using WebSockets to show when a user is typing.
- **Search Functionality**: Allow users to search their messages by keywords or sender.
- **Notifications**: Implement a notifications table or logic to alert users of new messages or activities.

### Conclusion

This setup gives you a comprehensive starting point for managing messages, users, and presence statuses in your messaging application. You can extend these functionalities as your application evolves. Let me know if you need further customization or additional features!
